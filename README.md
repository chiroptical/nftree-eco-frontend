The frontend for nftree.eco

## What is nftree.eco?

nftree.eco is a tree adoption website with one goal: plant more trees. I will
work with cities who have documented planted trees in their neighborhoods and
turn them into non-fungible tokens for users to purchase. After you purchase a
token you can choose to trade or make friends with other trees. To trade your
trees you will need its' unique address and optionally you can plant more
trees via [The Good Api](good-api).

Ultimately, nftree.eco will be run as a non-profit with the goal of increasing
tree equity in city landscapes.

## What it is not

This is **not** a blockchain project and never will be.
